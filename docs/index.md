## Why I Wrote This Book

I wrote this book because I always found it surprisingly difficult to find high-quality, relevant material on C++.
It was the first programming language I—and many others—learned in school, but unfortunately, it was taught in a way that made it seem terrible.

We were using a very old version of the language, and the teaching style leaned heavily on the old “C with Classes” approach—the way C++ was originally introduced—which almost everyone disliked.
At the time, I didn’t understand much and I certainly didn’t learn enough to feel confident with the language; I just felt lost.

Disappointed, I moved on to other languages with gentler learning curves and started teaching myself programming from scratch, combining what little I’d learned in school with online tutorials and personal projects.
Over time, I became fascinated with low-level performance programming—especially game development and the idea of building my own game engines.
That curiosity eventually brought me back to C++, and years later, to writing this book.

## Why C++ Matters

Anything that demands raw performance or fine-grained control over hardware is usually a perfect fit for C++.
From game engines and high-frequency trading systems to artificial intelligence, computer vision, robotics, and aerospace software—C++ powers them all.

It sits in a unique spot between low-level languages like C and high-level, more abstract ones like Python.
You get the control and speed of the former, but with features that make building large, complex systems manageable.
That balance is what makes C++ so enduring.

Even after decades of evolution, C++ remains one of the most widely used languages in the world.
Major engines like Unreal, browsers like Chrome, and countless operating systems and embedded systems rely on it every day.
It’s not just a legacy technology—it’s an essential one.

And while newer languages often promise simplicity or safety, few can match the sheer versatility, maturity, and ecosystem that C++ offers.
Once you learn it well, you’ll find that the skills transfer naturally to almost any other language or domain.

## What You’ll Find Here

When I finally came back to C++, I realized it wasn’t the confusing, outdated language I had remembered.
Modern C++ is powerful, expressive, and—surprisingly—fun to use once you understand how its pieces fit together.
But it took me a while to see that.

Coming from high-level languages like Python, even simple low-level concepts felt foreign at first.
I wasn’t just trying to write programs—I wanted to understand what was actually happening behind the scenes.
That curiosity pushed me through a lot of trial and error, and even more late-night debugging sessions.

Over time, I started to piece things together and realized that C++ didn’t have to feel intimidating.
It just needed to be explained in a way that made sense.
That’s what this book aims to do: to make C++ approachable without dumbing it down, and to guide you from the absolute basics to building a complete game from scratch—no pre-built engines, no magic libraries, just real code.

If you’ve ever felt frustrated learning C++ or felt like it was “too hard,” this book is for you.
My goal is that by the end, you’ll not only understand how C++ works but also feel confident and maybe even a little excited about using it.
